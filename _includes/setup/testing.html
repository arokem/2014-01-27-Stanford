How do you know if your setup works? To test the installation, open the Canopy
application. On the first launch of the application, you will be asked whether
you would like to configure the Canopy python to be your default python
environment. Please accept this and continue.
</p>

<p>If you are on a Windows machine, make sure that you run the<a href="{{page.root}}/setup/swc-installation-test-libraries.py">extra Windows installation script</a>, following the same instructions as below for the check installation script below, before running the script below.</p>

<p>
Download <a href="{{page.root}}/setup/swc-installation-test-libraries.py">This
script</a>. Open the script in the Canopy editor and click the "run" button
(looks like a green rightward-pointing arrow, or "play" icon). You will be
asked by the application whether you would like to "see the Python
pane". You should see something that looks like this:

</p>
<p>
<code>check Git (git)... </t> pass <br>
check Nose (nosetests)... </t> pass<br>
check Nose Python package (nose)... </t> pass <br>
check Python version (python)... </t> pass <br>
check IPython script (ipython)... </t> pass <br>
check NumPy (numpy)... </t> pass <br>
check SciPy (scipy)... </t> pass <br>
check Matplotlib (matplotlib)... </t> pass <br> </code>
</p>

<p>
Assuming you got all that, you are good to go.</p>

<p>If you are on Windows and have installed Git Bash, you may see that you get a <code>'pass'</code> for everything except for the "check Git" line. If this is the case, open the Git Bash program and type <code>git --version</code>, then hit Return, in the window that pops up. If this prints some number, then you're all set. If it prints "command not found" or something similar, then you should ask the instructors for installation assistance.</p>

<p>
Aside from the above, of any of those <code>'pass'</code> comes up as <code>'fail'</code>, please get in touch with the instructors in advance of the bootcamp.
